# WeatherApp Project

## Overview
This project is a Java-based weather application that I developed as part of my learning process in software development. The core code and instructional guidance were adopted from a helpful tutorial by [TapTap](https://youtu.be/8ZcEYv2ezWc?si=bcf3bHd890oGfAno).

## Modifications and Enhancements
While the foundational structure of this application was derived from the tutorial, I've made several modifications to enhance understanding and functionality:
- **Variable Renaming**: Updated variable names for improved code clarity and maintainability.
- **Comment Addition**: Added comprehensive comments to explain the logic and functionality of the code more clearly.
- **JSON ID Adjustment**: Changed the ID in the JSON object to ensure compatibility and functionality on my system.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I have gained a substantial amount of practical knowledge and skills:
- **JSON Management**: Learned the differences between JSON Objects, Arrays, and Strings, and how to manage these data structures in Java.
- **API Integration**: Understood the process of making HTTP connections to consume APIs, and how to retrieve and store data using the `StringBuilder` class for effective parsing.
- **GUI Development**: Enhanced understanding of GUI application development specifically through Java Swing, which has furthered my ability to create interactive user interfaces.
